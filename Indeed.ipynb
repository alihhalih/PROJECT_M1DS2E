    "There are many ways to scrape data from a job posting website. Depending on the website structure and where the required data can be found, we may  need to scrape only the main page,  or we may need to click on each job posting and be directed to a new url to find the \n",
    "data. Furthemore, we have to take into consideration that job postings typically span multiple pages, and there exists many ways to iterate over the \n",
    "pages (by url, by clicking on the 'next page' button', loading more jobs on the same page button, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Collecting links for each job posting \n",
    "Before we start, we need to identify what type of data we want to scrape. Since our ultimate goal is to allow the user to apply directly on the company's website (either after receiving the jobs by mail, or by searching on our interface), a crucial element is the company's website url, which is typically found after we click on the individual job posting of the main page and get redirected to the detailed job posting website. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem** : if we decide to scrape the data by clicking on each job posting, extracting information, then coming back to the main page, we receive the'Stale element' error notification, which is probably caused by the dynamically changing nature of the website (elements sometimes go missing after we quit then come back to the same page)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** : instead of clicking, we can extract the href link that takes us to the detailed job posting, which can be scraped from the main page on Indeed. We repeat this process for each job posting on the page, and store them all in a list (job_details_links)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we do this for the first page, we have to iterate over other pages. We find that clicking on the 'next page button isn't always optimal because\n",
    "most of the times we will receive an error saying the element was intercepted, and another element was clicked instead. On another hand, Indeed\n",
    "doesn't have a 'load more jobs' button, so we remove this possibility. "

The result is the association of the number of the arondissement as the first number in the postal code (for example, if a job's location is identified as Paris 1er with a postal code of 75 or 75000, the postal code will appear in the list (and susbsequently in the dataframe) as 17 instead of 75)\n",

    "In this next part, we will focus on building the interface. From this, users will be able to define specific criteria (job location, company name, keyword in job title, etc...) and search for job postings accordingly.\n",
    "### A) Interface design\n",
    "The interface design is divided into 2 parts. The first relates to searching jobs and directly seeing them, while the second relates to receiving an email containing the filtered jobs. We will present the interface creation code first, and then the functions that it uses. However, when running the code and testing it, **<font color=\"red\"> IT IS IMPORTANT TO RUN ALL THE FUNCTIONS BELOW THIS CODE BEFORE RUNNING THE INTERFACE CODE <font color=\"red\">**\n",
    "#### 1. Job searching\n",
    "The first step in creating an interface consists of designing it, which means we create different interactable objects inside of a window (called root). Specifically, we have decided to create 6 objects with which the user can interact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword as text entry** : this allows the user to specify a company's name (for example Orange) or a job title (for example Consultant).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contract type as Combobox** : this allows the user to choose a contract type among dropdown options (CDI, CDD, Stage, Alternance, Contrat d'apprentissage or freelance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **City as text entry** : this allows the user to enter the city's name\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Postal code as entry**: Same as city but for postal code (2 numbers only)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Possibility of remote work as Combobox**: same as contract type but for remote work. Options vary between 'Télétravail complet', 'Télétravail partiel' and 'Télétravail occasionnel'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search button**: when clicked, this allows the user to search for the job postings from our dataframe based on the selected criteria. To activate the search button so that it becomes interactive, we will refer to the 'search_jobs' function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each object, we will specify its title (for example Keyword, Contract type, ...), its type (Text entry, Combobox, ...) and its position in the window (using the grid function)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Receiving Email\n",
    "In the second part of the interface, we will upgrade the interface so that the user can choose receiving the filtered jobs by mail. The word 'choice' is very important. Indeed, we introduce a new interactable checkbox which displays additional parts of the interface **ONLY** when clicked. This is done when the user wishes to receive the jobs by email.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user clicks on the checkbox, 3 new objects appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email as text entry** : allows user the enter his email\n",
    "- \n",
    "- **Send jobs by mail as button** : when clicked, an message will be sent to the email entered, containing the job filtered based on the criteria"
